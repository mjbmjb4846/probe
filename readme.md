# Sensor Readings Interface

This project provides the web interface for displaying Vaisala DMT364 sensor readings, including dewpoint temperature, mixing ratio, sensor saturation rate, and sensor temperature. The interface also includes features for exporting and importing data, saving and loading data as cookies, and fetching the internal microcontroller's IP address.
